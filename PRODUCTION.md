# (Follow your deployment process)

# 2. Run smoke tests on staging
pnpm test:e2e --config=staging

# 3. Deploy to production
# (Follow your deployment process)

# 4. Run smoke tests on production
# (Verify critical paths)
```

### 4. Post-Deployment

- Unacceptable performance degradation
- Failed health checks

### Rollback Steps

1. **Immediate**: Stop sending traffic to new version
2. **Switch**: Route traffic back to previous version
3. **Verify**: Confirm previous version working
4. **Investigate**: Determine root cause
5. **Document**: Record incident details
6. **Fix**: Prepare corrected version
7. **Redeploy**: Follow deployment process
